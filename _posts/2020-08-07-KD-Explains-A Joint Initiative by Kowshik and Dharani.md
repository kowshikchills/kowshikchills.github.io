Being avid readers of blogs and books, we wanted to come up with blogs that gives readers a great perspective with real world applications and get the gist that sticks to mind. Our intention is to untangle intricate subjects to sow enduring knowledge in the readers mind. Not only technical we also bring in various topics like history, new innovations, finance etc., We really respect readers interests and whatever we write is solely our perspective. Let's all try to improve the knowledge and make the world a better place to learn. Thank You!

Hailed from IIT Madras. Data science has been my core interest since 5 years with 3 years of industry experience. I currently work in Algorithmic trading. In my experience I understood that with the soaring competition in data science day by day, one has to put an extensive effort to get accustomed with emerging technologies like Reinforcement learning, game theory etc., These interesting and new topics are mostly in the form of research papers or journals. I found there is a need to bring the subject and its applications in a more approchable way. My quench for knowledge includes learning history and other intriguing topics. This inquisitiveness has led me to comprise them all in a lucid way. Hope you learn a new thing from every blog here. Don't forget to share your feedback ðŸ˜Š

Graduated from DAIICT, I have joined an analytics firm. I have 2+ experience in data analytics. I believe any data set has a lot of stories to unravel. In my experience when working with real word data sets, not all problems end with deploying a Machine learning model, a complete analysis is expected by any business. So I have sharpend my skills in ML, DL and Visualisation to facilitate the industry need. When I started learning ML and DL, I found existing blogs explain a topic on an over all level and I had to follow some or the other book to get to know the derivations and Math behind it later, which obviously consumed more time. I started to put my learnings in blogs explaining methodically with mathematical equations, derivations and little bit of code that comprehends a topic well. I also keep drawn to learn interesting things happening around the world and if I feel it's something one needs to know, I keep adding them here. I hope every blog here gives you a good learning point.
